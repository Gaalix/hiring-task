## Cool API Tricks

- Use `bot.sendDice()` to roll a virtual dice or slot machine
- Implement `bot.sendPoll()` to create funny polls in group chats
- Use `bot.sendVoice()` to make the bot "speak" using text-to-speech
- Create a "mood detector" using `bot.sendAnimation()` based on message sentiment
- Implement a "chat roulette" using `bot.getChatMember()` and `bot.restrictChatMember()`

## Revolutionary idea: The AI Roulette Chatbot

Imagine a Telegram bot that combines AI responses with gambling:

- Users ask questions to the bot
- The bot "gambles" internally to determine the type of response
- Responses vary based on the gambling outcome:
  - Lucky spin: Get a helpful, friendly AI answer
  - Unlucky spin: Receive an angry AI response, berating you for the "stupid" question
  - Middle ground: Get a sarcastic answer that leaves you wondering if it's genuine or not
- Users can "bet" on the type of response they'll get, adding another layer of gambling
- Streak system: Consecutive correct bets unlock special bot personalities or features

Remember: Use bots wisely and gamble responsibly!
